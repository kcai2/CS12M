Most of the lines have words in them.
Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,
Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.
And in the doubtful war, before he won
The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;
From whence the race of Alban fathers come,
And the long glories of majestic Rome.
O Muse!  the causes and the crimes relate;
For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began
Or exercise their spite in human woe?
Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,
An ancient town was seated on the sea;
A Tyrian colony;  the people made
Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:
Carthage the name;  belov'd by Juno more
Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.
(Long cited by the people of the sky,)
That times to come should see the Trojan race
Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway
Should on the necks of all the nations lay.
Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late
For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.
Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd
For this, far distant from the Latian coast
She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;
Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.
Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
Within this wooden O the very casques
That did affright the air at Agincourt?
Suppose within the girdle of these walls
Think when we talk of horses, that you see them
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;
Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,
Turning the accomplishment of many years
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,
